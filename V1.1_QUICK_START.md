# v1.1 Quick Start Guide

## Try the New Features

### 3D Visualization

1. Navigate to `/builder` page
2. Click the **"3D"** button in the header (next to "2D")
3. Interact with the 3D view:
   - **Rotate**: Left-click and drag
   - **Zoom**: Scroll wheel or pinch
   - **Pan**: Right-click and drag
4. Click any node to select it (glows and rotates)
5. Switch back to 2D anytime - your selection persists!

### AI Suggestions

1. In the builder, drag some nodes onto the canvas
2. Connect them with edges
3. Watch the **Suggestions Panel** on the right:
   - Shows workflow score (0-100)
   - Lists optimizations, warnings, and quality tips
4. Try these scenarios:

#### Test Parallelization
```
Start → Agent 1 → End
      → Agent 2 →
```
**Expected**: Suggestion to group Agent 1 and Agent 2 into a parallel node

#### Test Loop Warning
- Add a Loop node
- Don't set `maxIterations` in config
**Expected**: Warning about infinite loop risk

#### Test Dead End
- Add an Agent node
- Don't connect it to anything
**Expected**: Warning about dead-end node

#### Test Quality Score
- Add start and end nodes
- Add error handling conditions
**Expected**: Higher workflow score

## Demo Workflow

Create this workflow to see all features:

```
Start Node
    ↓
Validation (condition)
    ↓
Parallel Node
    ├→ Agent 1 (process data)
    ├→ Agent 2 (analyze)
    └→ Tool (log)
    ↓
Loop (with maxIterations: 3)
    ↓
End Node
```

**Expected Suggestions**:
- ✅ Good parallelization
- ✅ Has start/end nodes
- ⚠️ Add error handling to agents
- ℹ️ Consider adding logging

**Workflow Score**: ~85-90/100

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` - Undo
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Y` - Redo
- `Delete` - Delete selected node
- `Escape` - Deselect all

## Tips & Tricks

### 3D View
- **Lost in space?** Click a node to center view
- **Too dark?** Environment lighting adjusts automatically
- **Can't see labels?** Zoom in closer
- **Performance slow?** Switch to 2D for large workflows (50+ nodes)

### Suggestions
- **Too many suggestions?** Dismiss ones you've addressed
- **Collapsed panel?** Click the `<` chevron to expand
- **Focus not working?** Make sure you're in 2D mode
- **Score not improving?** Read quality suggestions for tips

### Best Practices
1. Always add start and end nodes
2. Set timeouts for tool nodes
3. Add error handling to agents
4. Use parallel nodes for independent tasks
5. Validate inputs early with condition nodes

## Troubleshooting

### 3D view is blank
- Check browser console for WebGL errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled in browser

### Suggestions not updating
- Wait 1 second after making changes (debounced)
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify `/api/suggestions/analyze` endpoint is accessible

### Node badges not showing
- Make sure nodes are connected to workflow
- Check if suggestions have `nodeIds` array
- Verify `SuggestionBadge` component is rendering

---

## API Reference

### Analyze Workflow
```typescript
POST /api/suggestions/analyze

Body:
{
  nodes: Node[],
  edges: Edge[],
  config?: {
    checkParallelization?: boolean,
    checkWarnings?: boolean,
    checkQuality?: boolean,
  }
}

Response:
{
  suggestions: Suggestion[],
  workflowScore: number
}
```

### Suggestion Object
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  type: 'optimization' | 'warning' | 'quality',
  title: string,
  description: string,
  impact?: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
  estimatedSpeedup?: string,
  mitigation?: string,
  nodeIds?: string[]
}
```

---

## Configuration

### Disable Suggestions
In `app/builder/page.tsx`, comment out the analysis useEffect:

```typescript
// Comment this out to disable suggestions
// useEffect(() => { ... }, [nodes, edges]);
```

### Change Analysis Debounce
In `app/builder/page.tsx`, line ~75:

```typescript
const timer = setTimeout(async () => {
  // ...
}, 1000); // Change to 2000 for 2 second debounce
```

### Adjust 3D Depth Layers
In `types/visualization.ts`, modify `DEFAULT_LAYOUT_CONFIG`:

```typescript
depthLayers: {
  start: 0,
  end: 0,
  agent: -50,    // Change these values
  tool: -100,    // to adjust depth
  // ...
}
```

---

## Browser Support

### Recommended
- Chrome 90+ ✅
- Firefox 88+ ✅
- Edge 90+ ✅
- Safari 14+ ✅

### Requirements
- WebGL 2.0 support
- ES6+ JavaScript
- CSS Grid support
- LocalStorage enabled

---

## Performance Tips

### For Large Workflows (50+ nodes)
1. Use 2D mode for editing
2. Switch to 3D only for visualization
3. Collapse suggestions panel when not needed
4. Disable real-time analysis:
   ```typescript
   config: { checkQuality: false }
   ```

### For Low-End Devices
1. Reduce node count in viewport
2. Use MiniMap for navigation
3. Disable 3D view
4. Clear browser cache periodically
